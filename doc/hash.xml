<Heading>The idea of hashing</Heading>

If one wants to store
a certain set of similar objects and want to quickly access a given
one (or come back with the result that it is unknown), the first idea
would be to store them in a list, possibly sorted for faster access.
This however still would need <M>\log(n)</M> comparisons to access
a given element. 

<P/>
Therefore one uses a much bigger array and uses a function on the
space of possible objects with integer values to decide, where in the
array to store a certain object. If this so called hash function
distributes the actually stored objects well enough over the array,
in average the access time is contant.
