===========================================================================
 This file describes changes in the orb package beginning from version 1.2:
===========================================================================

==========================
 Changes from 1.5 -> 2.0:
==========================

  - Variant of "rattle" for random elements in normal closure.
  - Fixed 64bit issue for hash functions for compressed vectors.
  - Make compatible to GAP 4.4 again
  - New chapter as an example of OrbitBySuborbit technology
  - Update of documentation to code
  - Sort out licensing business
  - Clean up examples directory
  - Added Co1 example to documentation
  - Added M11 example to documentation
  - Release revision 187 as version 2.0


==========================
 Changes from 1.4 -> 1.5:
==========================

  - Fixed documentation of ActionOnOrbit.
  - New FindSuborbits methods and OrbitIntersectionMatrix to compute
    condensed permutation modules in smaller cases.
  - Improved methods for Intersection2 and IntersectSet for hash
    orbits and perm on int orbits.
  - Made FindShortGeneratorsOfSubgroup an operation.
  - Methods for intersections of orbits.
  - Fixed bug in the unpickling of caches.
  - Fixed case of one generator in product replacers.
  - Take out Randomize methods for gf2 and 8bit vectors and matrices.
    They will reappear in GAP >= 4.5.
  - New method for finding transversals in matrix groups.
  - Use "Rattle" in product replacers (can be switched off)
  - Release revision 149 as version 1.5, which is intended to be
    a preliminary version without proper documentation.


==========================
 Changes from 1.3 -> 1.4:
==========================

  - Picklers for orbits, caches, orbits-by-suborbits and other stuff.
  - Action on subspaces for orbits-by-suborbits.
  - Fixed bug in \in method for permutations on integer orbits.
  - Picklers for product replacer objects and random searcher objects.
  - Release revision 129 as version 1.4


==========================
 Changes from 1.2 -> 1.3:
==========================

  - random sources are now in the library, thus, orb will only work
    with GAP >= 4.4.8 and GAP.dev from now on
  - Moved realrandom.* to the IO package.
  - OrbitBySuborbitKnownSize
  - lots of small changes, forgot to take notes
